# 35MHz-RC-Telemetry
Telemetry system for 35MHz RC model airplanes

With the use of a LoRa 433MHz system, the 35MHz RC Telemetry is designed for the old 35MHz TX RX system.

Also, the system is powerful enough for use with a 2.4GHz system. The design is for a range of 4km what is further than most 2.4GHz systems.

A microcontroller with the LoRa module and sensors (digital as analog) is placed in the model. This is the master of the system. The master can send to multiple slaves ad the same time.

A microcontroller with the LoRa module and an LCD screen with buttons is attached to the transmitter. 
If the system is configured as one slave, normal mode, the slave can setup the master remotely. On multiple slaves mode, the master is in a fixed setup.
